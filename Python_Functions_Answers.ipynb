    "## Using Functions for code re-use\n",
    "If you tried the exercise on developing a quiz generator based on the hypertension treatment flow chart, you would have realised that you started to type the same code over and over again, but with some slight variations. To save the time and effort of re-writing code the use of **functions** is important. In python, you **define** a function using the `def` keyword like so `def my_function():`. The naming rules for functions are similar to variables. However, note that the `()` is not part of the function name but defines the **arguments** that the function will **accept**. We will explore this further later, but for now, fill in the function below with any code you wish e.g `print(\"hello world\")` and **call** the function by typing the function name with the brackets like so `my_function()`.  \n",

    "As you can see, functions allow you to write code once and use it as many times as you see fit. However, the function above is not particularly useful, because it is difficult to see how you might **generalise** it to cover a range of use cases. For instance, the **NEWS** metric is dependent on several basic obs, and if you were to create a function to calculate the NEWS metric, you would need to be able to define those basic obs **when you call the function** rather than hard-code it into the function itself. It might be possible to do something like this, if you run the code block below."

Briefly, **scope** refers to whether a particular variable is visible to the current block of code or not, and **bubbling** refers to the process of checking larger and larger blocks of code if a variable is used and not present in the current **scope**. We will go into this in more detail later. However, the function above is prone to error, because if the variable `x` is not defined outside of the function, there will be an error. Furthermore, because the variable `x` can be shared across multiple functions, changing it will affect not only the function you intended and can cause **side effects**. A whole paradigm called **functional programming** is devoted to programming using **only pure functions**, of which one of the advantages is to eliminate such side effects.  \n",

    "## More complex uses of functions - Recursion\n",
    "While it is useful to substitute for a particular block of code. There are other interesting things you can do with them. For instance **recursion** is the act of **calling** a function **within** itself. This is frequently used in **functional programming** where recursion is used to replace loops. Recursion and a functional approach to problems often allows for a much more concise and elegant expression than **imperative programming** which is the style that you have been using up till now, where code is executed sequentially in a linear fashion. A simple example would be writing a recursive function to determine if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence which reads the same forwards and backwards, and is commonly a property of the target sequence of restriction enzymes. Below is a schematic of how such a program might work.  \n",
    "![](img/recursionstack.jpg)  \n",
    "While the above algorithm could easily be implemented using loops, try to do so using recursion instead. All recursive algorithms must have a base/termination condition, or else it would continue to call itself forever, much like an infinite loop. A side note is that the blue arrows and boxes in the diagram above represent the **stack**, which is a memory structure in the computer that keeps track of the scope of various functions. When a function is called, all the variables and instructions coded in the function are bundled together into a **frame** (as in a box) and **pushed** onto the **stack**. When the function finishes its calculations, it is said to **resolve** and **returns** its output to the **frame** below it. In python, the default max height of the stack is 1024, so you cannot recursively call functions more than 1024 times before python gives you an error. If you wish, you can try implementing the algorithm using loops as well."

    "## More complex uses of functions - Passing functions into functions\n",
    "Up till now, we have been passing only values such as integers, strings, and floats, as well as data structures like lists to functions. However, a function itself can be passed into a function. This is a property of **first order functions**, that they can be treated in the same way as values. If you define a function that accepts another function as an argument, then you have defined a **higher order function**. One of the advantages of such functions is the ability to generalise an algorithm even further, increasing the flexibility and reusability of your code. For example, if you are familiar the the **R programming language** and the various **apply** functions, you can see how the function **maps** whatever function you pass it to the vector/dataframe by appling the given function to each row/column/element of a vector/dataframe. Another use for such functions is to generalise sorting functions. Sorting functions can work on anything upon which a comparison can be made. While we have been comparing strings and numeric values, we may wish to compare more complex **objects** where there may be no obvious comparison. Instead of re-writing sorting functions with the same logic but different comparison operators, we can define a higher order sorting function that accepts the data and any **comparison function** that is suitable for the data. An example of integer comparison can be seen below. Run the program to see what happens."

    "#### A note on Time Complexity\n",
    "A fundamental concept in computer science is that of the **time complexity** of algorithms. Time complexity is an estimate of the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of how long it will take to run and is often expressed as a **function** of the **size of the input**. There are several versions of time complexity, such as best-case time, average time, worst-case time and so on. A commonly used version is worst-case, and is often referred to as **Big-O notation** as seen above **O(n^2)** and **O(nlogn)**. There is also a **space complexity** which refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of how much memory it requires to run. There tends to be less emphasis on this, as memory is often not the limiting factor for algorithms. However, in cases of **big data** both space and time complexity need to be considered and increasingly algorithms need to be both space and time efficient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "How do you determine what the time complexity of an algorithm is? One very rough way is to look at how many nested for loops there are that run on the input data. If you look at the insertion sort below, how many nested for loops can you see. If the size of the list input is n, and in a for loop, each element must be processed, increasing the input size by 1 would increase processing time by 1 as well, resulting in a running time of **O(n+1)**. However, in complexity analysis only the order of the expression matters, so constants are dropped, so a single for loop has a time complexity of **O(n)** because as you increase the input size, the time taken **increases linearly**. However, if you have nested for loops, both running on the input, increasing the size by 1 will result in an increase in running time of **2n + 1**, which is not linear. If the time complexity of the algorithm was **O(n^2)** increasing the input size by 1 would give **O((n+1)^2)** which is equivalent to **O(n^2 + 2n +1)**. However, once again we simplify the notation by only taking the term with the highest impact as n tends to infinite and we get **O(n^2)**."
